This is a list of observations that you will have to do manually in case you're setting up a new
Jenkins environment for the puprose of running these jobs.

 - EnvFile plugin is not working as expected in my experience, thus you'll have to change a couple
   of job config.xml files which are trying to use this plugin. We will move away from using this
   plugin and implement a different solution soon

 - iptable rules! need to open port 443 for the web services. 

 - the Scripler plugin provides the functionality to execute stored groovy scripts. These usage of
   these groovy scripts are configured in the job config.xmls, but for some reason the name of the
   called groovy script is not picket up by jenkins when importing a job config.xml for the first 
   time. The solution is to go and configure the job from the UI to use a specific groovy script
   (find-host-by-label)

 - you should run a template configuration before the install-slave script. In case you did it the
   other way around, make sure to restart the Jenkins Slave Agent by disconnecting and reconncting
   to the slave machine through the UI. This will make sure to reload all the Env variables set by
   the template configuration.

 - the *.deploy jenkins jobs are configured to download the latest version of OA4MP server and client
   but currently there seems to be a problem with version 3.2 (client gets a null pointer exception
   upon creating the user private key). The previous vesion (3.1.2) should work.
